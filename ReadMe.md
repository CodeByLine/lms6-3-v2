This repo was my latest effort to restore a broken app (lms6-v2, which fell apart when I attempted to rename a model and all its relations) and learn how to use Django's CustomUser.

Notes from previous version:
This project is an extension of my exercise called lms6 (CustomUser - register, login, logout, password change/rest.)

Added "Course Catalog" in this app.

This app was originally based on the series of tutorials by SuperCoder ("Python Django Student Management System, https://youtu.be/y3llbdTtam4). One version can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/hackstarsj

In this app, I'll try to re-structure the folder setup, double check CustomUser is set up correctly.

lms5 was done mainly by following the tutorials by:
Create a CustomUser model - following Coding with Mitch:
